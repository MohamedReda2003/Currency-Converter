# Currency Converter With Python
The Currency Converter is a simple tool that allows users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. This project uses the Requests library to connect to an API for currency exchange data and Tkinter for the user interface. The project is built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to facilitate code reuse and maintainability.

## Features
- Real-time currency conversion based on the most recent exchange rates
- Simple and intuitive user interface designed with Tkinter
- Support for multiple currencies
- Clear and organized code structure using OOP principles

## To run the code on your machine:
  ### Install the required dependencies:
  ```
  pip install requests
  pip install tk  
  ```
  ### Then run the game:
  ```
  python currency_converter.py
  ```
  (this command is for Windows)


And here we go!
